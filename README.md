# Simple Storage with Hardhat

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## To run only 1 test case:

    run npx hardhat test --grep <test verb>
    or use It.only instead of just It

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
